Salary Calculator

## Description

This application takes inputs of various employee attributes (First Name, Last
  name, Employee ID, Title and Annual Salary) and displays them on a table
  after submission. Employee salary's are added up and divided by 12 to display
  a monthly cost.

An added Feature to this application is that if you fire one employee, your
company fails and all employees leave. Also, you cannot add any more employees,
and must start a new business.
